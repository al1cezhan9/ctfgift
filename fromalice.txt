flag{You'd both make fab professors!}

Tammy — thank you for your warm, relatable presence. Your kindness helped us feel instantly welcome. I remember you said you weren't sure you'd be a good at teaching, but I know all of us would vouch for the opposite. Good luck on your upcoming marathon! 🏃‍♀️💪

John — thank you for your honesty, kindness, and guidance throughout the summer. You are so articulate and wise, we hope some of this sagacity osmosis-ed into us throughout the summer! 

With appreciation,
— Alice
